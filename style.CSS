<h1>About Alexa Kwan</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Alexa Kwan. I am a seventh grader currently attending Miller Middle School. I love P.E. and spelling. My hobbies are swimming and track and field. I started swimming when I was 4 years old. I still swim now and enjoy competing and hanging out with my friends. Practice is everday for 2 hours. There is morning practice at 5:30 a.m. and Saturday at 6:00 a.m. I dread these days but I still go. I just finished my track season here at miller on Wednesday. I made league finals in the mile and the 800 meter. It was a very fun experience getting to know other people and trying out different races. I had a great time and hope to join next year. I have a pet fish named George and love watching him swim around. He eats a lot of rainbow food.
